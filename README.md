# Annular Solar Eclipse 2023

I conducted measurements of light intensity and temperature before, during, and after a solar eclipse, meticulously documenting the associated timeframes. These data unveil the effects of eclipses on Earth's luminosity and temperature.

## Data Overview

- **Light Intensity:** Measurements were taken on a scale from 0 to 1023.
- **Temperature:** Recorded in Celsius.
